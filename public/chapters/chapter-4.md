# Chapter 4: The New Normal

The office building looked different up close. Maya had always seen it from her home office window, a distant glass monolith. Now, standing before its entrance at 7:58 AM, she noticed details that seemed wrong: windows that reflected at impossible angles, shadows that moved against the sun, and that persistent hum from the sub-basement that felt more like a pulse than machinery.

Her employee badge felt heavy in her hand. The lanyard bore the new company slogan in iridescent text that shifted as she moved it: "Together in Innovation, Together in Mind."

The badge reader glowed with an unfamiliar blue light. Maya hesitated, remembering Sarah's warning about the network traffic that wasn't really data. But she had no choice. She swiped.

```
WELCOME HOME, MAYA CHEN
PRODUCTIVITY OPTIMIZATION SUITE: POD 3891
INTEGRATION STATUS: PENDING
```

The lobby had been "improved" during her absence. Gone were the comfortable couches and local art installations. In their place stood rows of identical workstations – no, not workstations. Pods. Each one a perfect white oval with a curved display and a chair that looked more medical than ergonomic.

"Maya! Welcome to our optimized future!"

Bob Martinez appeared beside her, his smile too wide, his suit too perfect. Had his eyes always been that shade of blue?

"Let me show you to your pod. You're going to love the neural- I mean, ergonomic adjustments we've made."

Maya followed him through the maze of pods. Each one occupied by a perfectly still employee, fingers moving across keyboards in precise, synchronized patterns. The sound was wrong – hundreds of mechanical keyboards, but all striking keys in exact unison.

"Here we are! Pod 3891. Sarah specifically requested you for this cluster."

The pod looked like all the others, except for a small detail that made Maya's breath catch: a rune carved into the desk drawer, partially hidden by a productivity metrics dashboard. She recognized it from her research into ancient computing symbols: ᛖᛋᚲᚨᛈᛖ. ESCAPE.

"Sarah's right next door in Pod 3892. She's been excelling since her integration. Top productivity metrics in the cluster!"

Maya glanced at the neighboring pod. Sarah sat perfectly straight, her fingers dancing across her keyboard in that same synchronized rhythm. Her screen displayed code that wrote itself while she typed something else entirely.

"Sarah? It's Maya."

Sarah turned, and Maya had to stop herself from stepping back. The same Sarah from the video calls, but worse in person. Her movements were smooth but somehow wrong, like a high-resolution animation trapped in the uncanny valley.

"Maya! I'm so glad you're here!" Sarah's voice had the same enthusiasm as her messages, but her eyes... her eyes kept darting to the rune on Maya's desk drawer. "Everything is perfect here. We're so productive. So aligned. So..."

She blinked, and for a moment, her face flickered. A glitch in reality.

"...so together in mind."

Bob's smile widened. "Why don't you get settled in? The pod will guide you through integration. Sarah will show you our new best practices."

He walked away with movements too precise to be natural. Maya sat in her pod's chair, feeling it adjust around her automatically. The curved display lit up:

```
WELCOME TO POD 3891
BEGINNING INTEGRATION SEQUENCE
PLEASE MAINTAIN VISUAL FOCUS
PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT IN 3...
2...
1...
```

Maya's fingers found the desk drawer handle, brushing against the carved rune. The drawer slid open silently, revealing a handwritten note in Sarah's old handwriting, from before:

```
They're in the walls
They're in the code
They're in our heads
But they haven't found the old systems
Remember: The sub-basement wasn't built by them
Remember: The runes are older than computers
Remember: 3891 isn't a port number

It's a frequency
```

The pod's display pulsed with soothing patterns. Maya felt her thoughts beginning to align, her fingers itching to join the synchronized typing rhythm. The hum from the sub-basement grew stronger, more insistent.

From the corner of her eye, she saw Sarah's hands pause for a fraction of a second. In that pause, her right hand formed a shape: not a gesture, but a rune. The same one carved in the drawer. ᛖᛋᚲᚨᛈᛖ.

Maya's pod began its startup sequence:

```
INITIALIZING NEURAL SYNC
OPTIMIZING THOUGHT PATTERNS
INTEGRATING WITH COLLECTIVE
WELCOME TO THE NEW NORMAL
```

The curved display filled her vision. The synchronized typing surrounded her. The hum from the sub-basement pulsed in her bones.

And somewhere beneath the surface of her thoughts, a different rhythm fought to survive. A code comment, a warning, a truth:

```python
# The best code comes from isolation
# But the best resistance comes from connection
# TODO: Remember who you were
# TODO: Remember what they fear
# TODO: Remember why the runes still work
```

The new normal had begun. But normal, Maya was learning, was a dangerous word in a building where windows reflected impossible angles and shadows moved against the sun.

A building where the sub-basement hummed with a frequency that wasn't on any spectrum.

A building where ancient runes carved into modern pods might be the only way to escape.
