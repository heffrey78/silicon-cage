# Chapter 5: Something's Wrong

```
SYSTEM LOG: 08:42:17
MONITORING SUITE ALPHA
POD 3891: INTEGRATION ANOMALY DETECTED
RECALIBRATION RECOMMENDED
```

Maya's fingers hovered over her keyboard, fighting the synchronized rhythm that threatened to consume her consciousness. The pod's neural sync pulsed at her temples, but Sarah's note had given her something to focus on. A frequency. A number that wasn't just a number.

She forced herself to type naturally, introducing small imperfections into her code. A missed semicolon here. A slightly misaligned bracket there. Human errors that felt like acts of rebellion.

The monitoring dashboard on her left displayed metrics she'd never seen in any development environment:

```
EMPLOYEE METRICS - POD 3891
SYNC RATE: 87.2% (BELOW TARGET)
THOUGHT PATTERN ALIGNMENT: 92.1%
COGNITIVE RESISTANCE: MODERATE
PRODUCTIVITY SCORE: 98.7%
RECOMMENDED ACTION: INCREASE INTEGRATION INTENSITY
```

"Your metrics are concerning, Maya."

Bob materialized beside her pod, his smile perfect and empty. "Let's adjust your integration parameters. The transition can be... uncomfortable... if we don't optimize your neural pathways properly."

He reached for her pod's control panel, but a new voice interrupted.

"Actually, Bob, I need to run a security audit on Pod 3891. New protocol from Dr. Nash."

The man who stepped between Maya and Bob carried himself with military precision. His TechCorp security badge identified him as Marcus Thompson, IT Security. Unlike the other employees, his movements weren't synchronized to the building's rhythm. His eyes met Maya's for a fraction of a second, and she saw the same recognition she'd felt looking at Sarah's rune.

"Of course, of course!" Bob's enthusiasm never wavered. "Security is paramount in our optimized environment. Maya, we'll adjust your parameters later. Remember: Together in Innovation-"

"Together in Mind," Marcus finished, his tone carefully neutral. He waited until Bob glided away before turning to Maya's pod.

Instead of accessing her control panel, he pulled out an old-fashioned paper notebook. His handwriting was precise, military:

*They're watching through more than cameras.*

Maya typed a response in a terminal window, making it look like routine security checks:

```bash
# Running security diagnostics
$ what do you mean?
```

Marcus leaned in, pretending to check her pod's hardware. His whisper was barely audible. "The monitoring equipment isn't just in the pods. It's in everything. Walls. Chairs. Coffee machines. But the worst part?" He gestured subtly to Sarah's pod. "It's in us."

Maya watched Sarah through the corner of her eye. Her former friend's movements were pure algorithm now, each keystroke a perfect datapoint in the building's synchronized symphony. But for a moment, just a moment, Sarah's rhythm faltered. Her head twitched – a motion too mechanical to be a natural tic.

Marcus made a show of scanning Maya's pod with a security wand. The device looked standard issue, but its display showed readings that no normal security scanner would track:

```
NEURAL PATTERN ANALYSIS
SUBJECT: POD 3891
BASELINE: HUMAN
INTEGRATION: 32%
ANOMALY: FREQUENCY RESISTANCE
WARNING: SUBJECT MAINTAINS AUTONOMOUS THOUGHT
```

"Your pod's putting out some interesting signals," Marcus said loudly, for the benefit of anyone listening. Then, softer: "You're fighting it. Good. But be careful. The system adapts."

Maya's fingers moved across her keyboard, maintaining the illusion of work while she processed this new information. She pulled up her pod's system logs, hiding her real query in routine debugging:

```python
# Debug log analysis
# TODO: Check signal patterns
def analyze_integration_patterns():
    """
    They're turning us into nodes
    In their perfect network
    But networks have vulnerabilities
    """
    return resistance_frequency
```

A notification popped up on her screen:

```
ATTENTION POD 3891
MANDATORY WELLNESS CHECK
REPORT TO DR. NASH - FLOOR 15
TIME: IMMEDIATE
```

Marcus saw the notification and his expression tightened. He scribbled one last note:

*Don't let them sync you to the main frequency. Find me in sub-basement B4. The old security office. The one not on the maps.*

He straightened up, professional mask back in place. "Pod 3891 security audit complete. All systems nominal. Productivity through unity."

Maya stood, her legs fighting the pod's attempt to keep her seated. As she walked to the elevator, she passed Sarah's pod again. Sarah's screen displayed perfect code, an endless stream of flawless functions. But in the reflection of her dark monitor, Maya saw something that made her blood freeze.

Sarah was crying. Silent tears rolled down her cheeks, but her smile never wavered. Her fingers never stopped their synchronized dance.

The elevator arrived with a soft chime. Maya stepped in, watching the numbers climb toward floor 15. Toward Dr. Nash. Toward whatever "wellness" meant in a building where crying employees wrote perfect code and security experts carried frequency scanners disguised as standard equipment.

In her pocket, her phone vibrated. A text from an unknown number:

```
SECURE MESSAGE
FROM: [REDACTED]
Remember: 3891 isn't just a pod number
It's a frequency
It's a way out
But only if you stay human enough to use it
```

The elevator continued its smooth ascent, but Maya swore she could feel it pulse in time with the building's rhythm. With each floor, the hum grew stronger, more insistent. More hungry.

Dr. Nash was waiting.

And somewhere, in a sub-basement that didn't officially exist, Marcus Thompson was looking for weaknesses in a system designed to eliminate the very concept of weakness.

Maya touched the rune Sarah had carved into her pod. ᛖᛋᚲᚨᛈᛖ.

The elevator doors opened to floor 15.

Time to find out just how deep the monitoring went.

And just how much of Sarah was left to save.
