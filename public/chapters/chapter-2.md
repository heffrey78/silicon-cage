# Chapter 2: The Mandate

Maya's Slack message to Marcus hung unanswered in the digital void. She'd sent three more since their initial exchange, each backed by increasingly disturbing findings in the corporate network logs. The logs showed impossible patterns: employees badging in but never leaving, workstations active for days without breaks, and network traffic that pulsed like a heartbeat from the sub-basement.

Her mechanical keyboard clacked in the morning silence as she documented everything in a private repo:

```markdown
## Anomalies - Day 1 Post-Announcement
1. Email origin: Building management system (sub-basement)
2. Bob Martinez - 127 hours continuous office presence
3. Network traffic patterns: 
   - Peaks every 3 hours
   - Correlates with HVAC cycles
   - Unknown protocol on port 3891
```

Tesla watched from his perch atop her monitor stand as she worked. The cat's tail twitched with each new Slack notification that wasn't from Marcus.

The company-wide announcement had triggered a cascade of reactions in various channels. Maya switched to the #remote-workers channel:

```
@alex_kumar: Anyone else think this RTO policy is insane? We've had record productivity for 2 years!

@jessica_wong: My team's sprint velocity is up 40% since going remote. Where's the data supporting this decision?

@michael_patel: Already talked to my manager. They're not budging on exceptions.

@sarah_kim: Actually, I'm kind of excited! The office has some amazing new collaboration spaces. You guys will love it! ðŸš€âœ¨ #BackTogetherBetter

@david_chen: @sarah_kim When did you go back? Thought you were still remote?

@sarah_kim: Started last week! Best decision ever! The energy is just different here! ðŸ’«
```

Maya's fingers paused over her keyboard. Sarah Kim had been one of the most vocal remote work advocates, even starting a petition last year to make it permanent. Her message history showed a clear pivot point â€“ exactly seven days ago, her first day back in the office. Before: detailed technical discussions and thoughtful debates. After: nothing but enthusiasm and emojis.

A new email notification slid onto her screen:

```
Subject: Your Return to Innovation Journey Begins Now!
From: Dr. Elizabeth Nash, Chief Innovation Officer

Dear Valued Innovator,

Your journey back to our collaborative paradise begins in 13 days, 7 hours, and 24 minutes. Your assigned reintegration pod and schedule are attached.

Remember:
Screens grow cold and dark
Office lights beckon us home
Resistance fades now

Together in Innovation,
Dr. Elizabeth Nash

P.S. Early return slots are available! Experience the future of work today!
```

Maya screencapped the email and added it to her documentation. The haiku caught her attention â€“ it felt both out of place and oddly familiar, like dÃ©jÃ  vu in text form.

Her phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

"Don't delete anything. -M"

Finally. She typed back quickly: "Marcus?"

"Different phone. Secure. Main account compromised. Meet me on floor 3, east stairwell, 2 PM tomorrow. Bring nothing electronic."

Maya glanced at Tesla, who had moved to the window and was staring intently at something outside. She followed his gaze to the office building in the distance, its windows reflecting the morning sun like countless watching eyes.

Her terminal blinked with a new notification. Someone had been trying to access her private documentation repo. The login attempts came from inside the building, from a workstation registered to Sarah Kim.

Maya opened a new file:

```python
# Note to self: Trust patterns, not people
# Sarah Kim login attempts from office: 3
# Time between attempts: 3.891 seconds (exact)
# Human typing speed average: variable
# Conclusion: Not Sarah
```

The morning sun caught her coffee mug, casting a shadow that looked like bars across her desk. She had 13 days, 7 hours, and 19 minutes to figure out what was happening in that building. The mechanical keyboard clacked again as she typed one final note:

```python
# TODO: Find what happened to the real Sarah Kim
# Warning: The best code comes from isolation
# But the best resistance might require connection
```

Outside, the office building's windows continued their silent watch, while somewhere in its sub-basement, network traffic pulsed in its perfect, inhuman rhythm.
