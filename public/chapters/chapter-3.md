# Chapter 3: Last Day of Freedom

Maya's home office felt different on her final remote workday. Every familiar object seemed to mock her with its impending absence: the perfectly positioned monitors, the custom mechanical keyboard with its precise actuation points, Tesla's cat bed mounted perfectly at desk height. In thirteen days, this carefully crafted workspace would become a museum to productivity past.

She'd spent the morning archiving her private repositories, encrypting her findings about the office anomalies. Her terminal displayed the latest backup status:

```bash
Encrypting: private/office-investigation/
[====================] 100%
Backup location: /dev/hidden/backup3891
Hash verification: COMPLETE
```

The number caught her eye. 3891. The same port number from the mysterious network traffic. She made a note to ask Marcus about it at their meeting later.

Her calendar notification chimed: "Final Remote All-Hands: Celebrating Our Return to Innovation!" Maya considered skipping it, but curiosity won out. She needed to observe more of the changed behavior patterns.

The video call grid filled her screen. Forty-two faces, each in their own digital square. Maya counted the expressions: seventeen with that same uncanny enthusiasm she'd seen in Sarah's messages, twenty-three showing various stages of concern or resignation, and two – herself and Marcus – carefully neutral.

Dr. Elizabeth Nash dominated the center square, her backdrop a pristine office wall bearing the company's new slogan: "Together in Innovation, Together in Mind."

"Welcome, valued innovators!" Nash's smile was perfect, practiced. "We're just twelve days, four hours, and seventeen minutes away from our grand reunification. I see many of you have already chosen to join us early – a wise choice! Sarah, would you like to share your experience?"

Sarah's video square brightened. The usual warm clutter of her home office was gone, replaced by stark white walls and the same slogan. "It's been transformative! The energy, the synchronicity – I've never felt more aligned with our mission. My productivity metrics have increased by 127% since returning!"

Maya noticed Sarah's eyes dart slightly left after each sentence, like reading from a script.

The chat sidebar filled with enthusiasm from the early returners, each message following the same pattern: exclamation points, productivity statistics, corporate buzzwords. Maya opened her terminal and wrote a quick script to analyze the message patterns:

```
# Message timing analysis
# Average time between responses: 3.891 seconds
# Keyword frequency: "innovation" (47), "together" (52), "productivity" (39)
# Conclusion: Automated or coordinated responses
```

Her private Slack channel with Marcus blinked:

```
@marcus_thompson: Check your personal email. NOW.
```

Maya opened her email in a private browser window. A new message waited, sender address: `employee_3891@devnull.local`

```
Subject: URGENT: Before Tomorrow's Meeting
From: [REDACTED]
To: maya.chen@personal.com

Maya,

If you're reading this, some part of me still exists. The changes are subtle at first. You start using their words, thinking their thoughts. By day three, you're suggesting others return early. By day five, you can't remember why you ever wanted to work from home.

I'm sending this through an old system they haven't found yet. Tomorrow will be too late for me, but you need to know:

1. The reintegration pods aren't for seating
2. The HVAC system isn't for air
3. The network traffic isn't data

Don't trust any communication after this, even if it comes from me. They're in my head now, but they haven't found all my commits yet.

Check the git history. I left breadcrumbs.

- S.K.
```

Maya's fingers flew across her keyboard, pulling up Sarah's last commits before returning to the office. Most were standard code updates, but one commit message from 3:89 AM (impossible timestamp) caught her eye:

```
commit 7d891e3891e3891e3891e3891e3891e
Author: sarah.kim@company.com
Date: [TIMESTAMP ERROR]

//TODO: Remember who you were
//TODO: The code isn't the only thing they're rewriting
//TODO: 3891 3891 3891 3891 3891
```

Her phone buzzed with another text from the unknown number: "Meeting time changed. Now. East stairwell. They know."

Maya started gathering her laptop, but another message stopped her:

"NO DEVICES. They're all compromised. Bring only your mind, while it's still yours."

She glanced at Tesla, who had moved to block her office door, fur slightly raised. Through her window, the office building's glass facade reflected the afternoon sun, each window a watching eye. For a moment, she thought she saw shapes moving in the sub-basement windows – impossible, since the sub-basement shouldn't have windows.

Her mechanical keyboard clacked one final time as she typed:

```markdown
# Note to self:
# If I come back enthusiastic about open offices
# If I start using too many exclamation points
# If I quote productivity metrics unprompted
# Then I am no longer me
# Then execute protocol_3891.py
```

Maya stood, leaving her phone, her laptop, all her carefully curated technology behind. Tesla meowed – a warning? a goodbye? – as she headed for the door. In the reflection of her blank monitors, she thought she saw her expression flicker into that same uncanny smile all the early returners wore.

She had one chance to find out what was happening in that building. One chance before she became another enthusiastic face in a video call, another productivity metric, another perfectly aligned innovator.

The office building waited, its windows watching, its sub-basement humming with network traffic that wasn't really network traffic, its ventilation system circulating something that wasn't really air.

Maya's final remote workday was ending. Her last day of freedom.

Her last day of being herself.
