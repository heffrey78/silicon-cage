# Chapter 1: Remote Paradise

The best code, like the best lies, comes from complete isolation.

Maya Chen had written this truth in a comment buried deep in her codebase three months ago. Now, cross-legged in her home office with her third cup of coffee steaming beside her mechanical keyboard, she wondered if she'd jinxed herself. The morning sun painted her monitors in Ohio gold, and her cat Tesla sprawled across the desk mat, paw occasionally swatting at her cursor movements.

Her terminal blinked with another merge request approval. Fourth one today, and it wasn't even noon. She smiled, fingers flying across her keyboard as she pulled the changes into main. Clean. Efficient. No meetings, no interruptions, noâ€”

The Teams notification sound shattered her flow state.

```
Bob Martinez - Head of Employee Experience
Hey Maya! ðŸ˜Š Quick sync? ðŸš€
```

Maya stared at the message. Bob had been one of the first to return to the office when they'd reopened the Columbus campus. He'd also been one of the most vocal critics of remote work before that. Now his messages came with emoji clusters like digital cheerleaders.

```
Maya Chen
In the middle of a deploy. Can we async?

Bob Martinez
This is about optimizing our collaborative synergy potential! ðŸ“ˆ
You'll want to hear this live! ðŸŽ¯
Camera on please! ðŸ‘€
```

Three exclamation points. Three emoji. The Bob she'd known for two years had communicated exclusively in bullet points and Jira tickets. She minimized her terminal and clicked accept on the video call, leaving her camera off out of spite.

"Maya!" Bob's face filled her screen, his smile too wide for 11:47 AM. The office behind him was all glass and chrome, empty except for a few distant figures hunched over keyboards. "You're missing out on so much energy here at the Hub! When was the last time you experienced true in-person ideation?"

Maya scratched Tesla behind the ears. "I pushed twenty commits yesterday, Bob. My ideation is fine."

"But imagine how many you could push with the power of physical proximity!" He leaned closer to his camera, and Maya resisted the urge to lean back from hers. "Actually, that's what I wanted to sync about. Have you checked your email in the last five minutes?"

She had not. Her email client was permanently relegated to her vertical monitor, notifications disabled. She glanced at it now and saw the subject line from Corporate Communications:

EXCITING NEWS: TechCorp's Return to Innovation Initiative!

"Bobâ€”"

"It's beautiful, isn't it?" His voice had taken on an almost reverential tone. "A return to real connection. Real collaboration. Real productivity."

Maya opened the email, scanning past corporate letterhead and buzzwords. Her coffee turned cold in her stomach.

MANDATORY RETURN TO OFFICE - EFFECTIVE TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY

"We're bringing everyone home, Maya." Bob's smile hadn't flickered. "Back to where they belong. Back toâ€”"

She hit the mute button and switched to her private Slack with Marcus in IT security.

```
@maya_chen: You seeing this RTO bullshit?
@marcus_thompson: Yeah. Something's wrong.
@maya_chen: Besides the obvious?
@marcus_thompson: Check the metadata on that email.
```

Maya pulled up the email source. The timestamp made her fingers pause on the keyboard.

```
@maya_chen: That's... not possible.
@marcus_thompson: 3 AM local time. When the building should be empty.
@maya_chen: Could be scheduled send?
@marcus_thompson: Look at the origin server.
```

She did. The email hadn't come from their usual corporate communications server. It had come from somewhere inside the Columbus campus. Specifically, from the sub-basement environmental control system.

"â€”and I can't wait to see your smiling face in the office!" Bob was still talking, his own smile now seeming more rictus than real. "We have so many exciting changes to share. You won't believe how much better everything is now. How much better everyone is."

Maya unmuted. "Bob, quick question. What's the best code you ever wrote?"

His smile didn't waver. "The code that brings us all together, of course! See you in two weeks, Maya. Camera on next time!"

The call ended. Maya stared at her monitors, at her deploy terminal still blinking success, at her cat now watching her with unusual intensity. She pulled up the corporate VPN logs, an old habit from her security rotation days.

Bob's laptop had been connected to the office network for 127 hours straight.

She opened a new file and began to type:

```python
# TODO: Document the last normal day
# Note: The best code, like the best lies, comes from complete isolation
# But isolation might be the only thing keeping us human
```

Tesla meowed, and Maya could have sworn it sounded like a warning.
